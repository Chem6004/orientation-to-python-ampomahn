    "### Mie First\n",
    "Mie theory provides a route to the exact solution to Maxwell's equations for light interacting with a spherical object; this is done by expanding the incident and scattered\n",
    "light waves in a basis of multi-polar functions; hence one usually speaks about the dipolar contribution to scattering, the quadrupolar contribution, the octupolar, and so on.  For very large particles, many orders of this expansion may be needed, but for small particles the scattering and absorption is dominated by the dipolar contribution.  Hence, for spherical nanoparticles that are less than or equal to about 10 nm in diameter, the Mie theory expansion is truncated after only the first term.  As a concrete example, the Mie theory expression for the absorption of a small spherical nanoparticle is as follows:\n",

    "Mie theory provides a classical electrodynamics treatment of the absorption of light by matter; of course we can use quantum mechanics to simulate the absorption of light, as well.  In analogy to our previous Mie theory treatment, we can assume that the interaction between our quantum system and light is dominated by dipolar interactions.  In this view, the absorption of light occurs under the following conditions:\n",

This leads to the typical \"light-matter\" contribution to Hamiltonians:\n",
